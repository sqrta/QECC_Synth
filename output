Hi Charles,

I am working on reproducing Fig.8 in your RL paper (i.e. construct a [[5,1,3]] code with two [[4,2,2] codes, two H tensors, and one S tensor). I have not successfully reproduced this result, so I want to make sure that I correctly construct the tensor enumerator for H and S. 

I get the Choi state of H gate by applying I \otimes H to |00>+|11> and get |00> + |01> + |10> - |11>. The stabilizer group for this stabilizer state can be generated by {II, XZ, ZX}. Is this correct?

For the S gate, I get the Choi state as |00>+i*|11> and the stabilizer group can be generated by {II, XY, YX}. Is this correct?

Sorry for bothering you with the implementation details. Thank you so much for your help in this project!

Best,
Haowei.
